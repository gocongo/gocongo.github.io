A Letter to DR Congo.  

An underestimated man can show an underestimated country how to rise to the top. 

More than 400 years before Moses, there was born a king that no one could recognize. This king held the key to the survival of a nation.  As a young boy, this uncrowned king received a dream of who he was to become. He knew who he was destined to become but his brothers hated him for it and sold him into slavery. This king’s name was Joseph. From king to slave overnight, Joseph may have had doubts about his prophetic gift.

I wonder: how did Joseph know to not give up?  He was sold as a slave to foreigners by his own family, yet Joseph continued with his prophetic gifting until one day he caught the notice of the King of Egypt.  

The enemy wanted Joseph to believe that his gift was a curse, afterall it landed him in slavery.  However, Joseph prevailed over this fear.  Joseph interpreted a dream for the Ruler of Egypt.  Because Joseph could interpret that dream, he prepared Egypt to survive many years of hardship.  Because Egypt was prepared for hardship and the nations around them were not, Egypt grew even more powerful by selling their supply of grain to the surrounding starving populations.  

During the great famine, some of the starving people that came to receive grain from Joseph were Joseph’s own brothers--the very brothers who sold him into slavery.  Joseph had the power to put all of them in jail or even kill them but he didn’t.  Joseph instead blessed them with grain and sent for his whole family to take refuge in Egypt.  

I believe the life of Joseph demonstrates what the people of Congo are facing now. 
In the early 1900’s a nation of foreigners decided Congo would be a huge asset to help them make tires for recently invented cars but they decided you could only serve as slaves in production of rubber from your own rubber trees.  Like Joseph’s brothers, these men did not see the richer calling on your life to be a nation that stewards great wealth. 

I ask you now: when these brothers come for your help, when their survival depends on you, will you turn your back? 

Our Father in Heaven has put a huge destiny on the people of Congo.  The enemy built up the lie that the resources given to you by God are a curse.  Similarly, Joseph’s gift got him discarded by his own family and put in jail.  Your gift has funded civil war on your own soil but, people of Congo, make no mistake you WILL conquer this lie.  You will unite in worship to one God. You are the sons and daughters of the most High God with a very rich inheritance to enjoy.
 
Your own brothers and neighbors did not recognize how valuable you are but our Father in Heaven knows. 
God put one of the largest treasure chests of wealth under your feet.  The soil upon which you live life could feed 1 billion people.  Under that soil is enough coltan, copper, diamonds, precious gems, and minerals to match the economic force of Europe and America combined.

Understand your nation as this: the largest bank in the world.  Right now the doors to the bank vault are broken.  Some have tried to steal from your bank but I bring some good news. God has heard your prayers; He has heard your worship.   He is revealing to you who you really are as Sons and Daughters of the Most High God.  Together you will restore the treasure of Congo.  In this room are leaders of a Nation that will lead Nations. The way you wield the wealth of your land to create beauty, health, hospitality, and sustainability will point to the greatest wealth of all--the Kingdom of Heaven.
